# Overview
This is an academic technical project presented by team analyzed-structures of CS-201 at Habib University. We have implemented and used Van Emde Boas Tree (a.k.a VEB) in C++ to solve nearest node problem in the best efficient way possible and incorporate its GUI using html.

# Problem Statement
Finding Nearest Node from a source node in O(log(log U)) time complexity.

# Application
